### The Application itself:
> 1 write added all the commands needed for installing, testing and building the application in the package.json files in the frontend and the backend 
> 2- I added the jobs inside circleci config.yml file for installing all the dependencies on both the frontend and backend of the application using the : `npm install` command inside package.json files.
> 3- Then I added the jobs for building the frontend and the backend by calling the corresponding scripts.

### AWS Deployment:
> 4- RDS Postgres database instance that has the database structure with all the data content and is linked to backend code via port 5432 (inside Elastic Beanstalk)

> 5- via port 3000 Elastic Beanstalk environment that handles the application environment and sends requests to RDS database and receives the response to be sent to the frontend inside S3 to display the relevant webpages to the user .
